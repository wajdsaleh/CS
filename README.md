# Daily Routine Program 
A Software Development Process of a -Daily Routine Program- project for CS181 course, presented to Dr. Abeer Alhujaylan.

## Project idea
The project is based on teamwork, each group consists of 4 students each student will take part and program it then all parts combined as one program.

## The project's parts
### 1.Study Time:
* Design a schedule that helps the user to study for five hours a day. Each day the user will study five courses, starting from Sunday till Saturday. Also, the code answers the user's inquiries about the course that will be studied according to the specific day and time in each time they want to know. 

### 2.Sport time (Using Recursion): 
* Design a program that helps the user finishes daily user-defined steps. If the user finishes their daily steps, the program will print: “Wow, you did a great job!”. If the user hasn't finished their steps, the program will print: “Ooops, you have not finished your daily steps! Try tomorrow”. 
   
### 3.Play time **(Which I programmed)**: 
* After the user finished their study and their daily exercise, they deserve some fun before they go to bed. Let's play the game: "Whoever reaches 20 first is a winner!". 
* The rules of the game are as follows:
    * The computer randomly determines who starts playing first. 
    * The computer randomly determines whether the user is allowed to use one or two numbers.     
    * The player who reaches number 20 first is the winner and is congratulated by typing the following sentence: “Congratulations! The first/second player is the winner!”.  
       
### 4.Creative question:
* Dr.Abeer left the idea of this question to us to think about, so we came up with a Reminder and TO-DO list idea.
* Every day we plan how our day will be, and what tasks we must do, so 'Wesam' writes a code that helps the user to plan their day and at the end, the user marked what they have finished.
